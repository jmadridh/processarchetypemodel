# Process API Model - Inchcape CEX
--- 
#### Inchcape CEX ####

This Process API Model is not accesible to expose functionalities to end users. 
A specific data format could facilitate and provide quick integration with this process api. 

### Connect with Systems API
---

### How it works ### 

This application accepts JSON messages which contains <object> information FROM a queue in a messaging infrastructure. 

The [Anypoint MQ Connector](https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-mq/) consumes new messages in a Queue. When the message has been consumed, this one will be recorded in a variable until this process API has the acknowledge response from the System API.

### Documentation ###

This Process API should be extended.
